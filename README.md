# Image-Processing
Gaussian, Salt and Pepper noise in images and Mean, Median filtering. 
The original rgb image is converted into Grayscale and then we apply 
Gaussian and Salt & Pepper noise.

Then we attempt to remove the noise by applying the Median and 
Mean filtering methods in our corrupted images.
